# Guess-The-Number

* This is a guess number game, where the system generates a random integer (between 0 and 20), and the user guesses the number;
* A corresponding message will be displayed based off user's input:
    * Too low: displays a too low message
    * Too high: displays a too high message
    * Correct guess: displays a successful message with number of guesses
    * Wrong guess: displays a failure message with the system generated secret number
